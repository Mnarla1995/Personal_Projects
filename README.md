# Personal Projects
---

This repository contains a collection of small, focused iOS projects built with **Swift** and **SwiftUI**. Each project explores a specific concept such as app architecture, state management, or UI composition.

---

## Projects

### 📱 Calculator
A simple yet well-structured calculator app built with **SwiftUI** using the **MVVM** architecture. Emphasizes clean `ViewModel` state management, custom button styles, and correctness of arithmetic logic.

---

### 🍰 DessertCuisine
An app for browsing dessert and meal content with category lists and detail screens. Useful for experimenting with asynchronous data loading in `ViewModel`, image handling, and SwiftUI layout composition.

---

### 🇺🇸 PresidentList
A compact, data-driven SwiftUI app that reads a local property list and presents entries in a `List`. Demonstrates `Codable`/plist parsing, `ObservableObject`-driven UI updates, and an embedded `WebView` helper for external links.

---

## Project Summaries

- **Calculator (`Calculator/`)**: Functional calculator implementation exploring input handling, expression evaluation, and polished SwiftUI controls.
- **DessertCuisine (`DessertCuisine/`)**: Content-driven demo with categories, list/detail navigation, and room to add caching or remote data sources.
- **PresidentList (`PresidentList/`)**: Lightweight example for local data parsing and list presentation; good starting point for search, sorting, or adding richer detail views.
